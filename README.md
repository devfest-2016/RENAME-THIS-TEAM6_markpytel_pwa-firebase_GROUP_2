# Team Success

Team Success is 5 people: Jack Huang, Sachin Verma, Samantha Bretons, BJ Cantaloupe, and Eric Tillberg.

Our app uses React and Firebase, and will tap into the Google Calendar API. The app is a scheduling app for tutors and students. Each user enters their free time into a calendar and, when both calendars are ready, the app will merge the two calendars and find a time for a lesson. The app will then propose the lesson time to each party for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the lesson will be entered into each partyâ€™s Google calendar.


* There are many opportunities to add value to this idea for an MVP, including:
  * pushing messages to tutors and students if and when one party might be late for a lesson
  * alerting a party in case of cancellation
  * giving live updates as to how far the tutor is from the meeting place (again, for the concern of being late)
  * giving a summary to each party of hours in lessons and money spent/earned
